Service ID: srv-d3u6cgripnbc738naa70
Dashboard URL: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3u6cgripnbc738naa70

STEP 1: UNSUSPEND SERVICE
1. Go to the dashboard URL above
2. Look for "Service Suspended" warning
3. Click the "Unsuspend" or "Resume" button
4. Wait for service to start initializing

STEP 2: TRIGGER DEPLOYMENT
1. After unsuspending, click "Manual Deploy" button
2. Select "Deploy latest commit" from dropdown
3. Click "Deploy" to start build process
4. Monitor build logs for errors

STEP 3: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
Once build completes, test these endpoints:
Health Check:
curl https://[your-service-name].onrender.com/api/health
Should return: {"status":"healthy","uptime":"..."}

Device List:
curl https://[your-service-name].onrender.com/api/device/list
Should return: {"code":0,"data":{}}

STEP 4: GET ACTUAL BACKEND URL
1. In Render dashboard, copy the full service URL (e.g., https://spark-backend-fixed-v2.onrender.com)
2. Save this URL - you'll need it for frontend configuration
3. Write it down exactly as shown, including https://

EXPECTED BUILD TIME: 3-5 minutes
EXPECTED ERRORS TO IGNORE: None - build should succeed completely

IF BUILD FAILS:
1. Check Render build logs for "go.mod" errors
2. Check for "Dockerfile" not found errors
3. Check for "config.json" not found errors
4. All of these should be fixed by previous steps
