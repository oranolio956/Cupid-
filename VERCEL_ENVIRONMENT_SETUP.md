# 🚀 Vercel Environment Variables Setup Guide

## Critical Fix for Mobile Loading Issues

Your mobile app is failing to load because Vercel doesn't have the required environment variables configured. Follow these steps to fix it:

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

Go to your Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
Select your project: `cupid-otys`
Navigate to: Settings → Environment Variables

### Add These EXACT Variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://cupid-1-njpo.onrender.com
REACT_APP_WS_URL = wss://cupid-1-njpo.onrender.com
```

### Environment Scope:
- ✅ Production
- ✅ Preview  
- ✅ Development

## 🎯 Why This Fixes the Issue

**Before (BROKEN):**
- Frontend tries to call `cupid-otys.vercel.app/api/device/list` (wrong URL)
- No environment variables = fallback to relative path
- Mobile browsers can't access localhost backend

**After (FIXED):**
- Frontend calls `https://cupid-1-njpo.onrender.com/api/device/list` (correct URL)
- Environment variables properly injected at build time
- Mobile browsers can access the production backend

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Add Environment Variables** (above)
2. **Redeploy** your Vercel project
3. **Test on Mobile** - should now load properly

## 🔍 Verification

After setting environment variables and redeploying:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Should show environment variables being set
2. **Test API Calls**: Mobile should call the correct backend URL
3. **Check Console**: No more "API Base URL: ." errors

## 📱 Mobile Testing

1. Clear browser cache on mobile
2. Visit: https://cupid-otys.vercel.app
3. Should see loading spinner, then device list (or error message if backend down)

## 🛠️ Backend Status

Your backend is deployed at: https://cupid-1-njpo.onrender.com

**Test Backend Health:**
```bash
curl https://cupid-1-njpo.onrender.com/api/health
```

**Test Device List:**
```bash
curl https://cupid-1-njpo.onrender.com/api/device/list
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

- ✅ Missing DeviceCard.css file created
- ✅ Backend URL configuration corrected
- ✅ Webpack fallback URLs updated
- ✅ Mobile error handling added
- ✅ Loading states implemented
- ✅ CORS configuration improved
- ✅ Environment variables guide created

Your mobile app should now load correctly! 🎉
