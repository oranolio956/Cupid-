- CPU, RAM, Disk usage
- Network statistics
- System uptime

âœ… **Remote Access**
- Terminal/command execution
- File upload/download
- Desktop streaming
- Screenshot capture

âœ… **Device Management**
- Auto-discovery
- Status tracking
- Multi-device support

âœ… **Professional UI**
- Mobile-optimized dashboard
- Desktop table view
- Real-time updates

## Access Information
### Dashboard
**URL:** https://cupid-otys.vercel.app
**Credentials:** 
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123` (Please change immediately after first login)

### Client Downloads
**URL:** https://cupid-otys.vercel.app/downloads.html
**Supported Platforms:**
- Windows 7/8/10/11 (64-bit)
- macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)

## Quick Start
1. **Access Dashboard**
   - Visit https://cupid-otys.vercel.app
   - Login with provided credentials
2. **Install Client**
   - Download from downloads page
   - Run with admin/root privileges
   - Device appears in dashboard within 10 seconds
3. **Start Managing**
   - Click device to access features
   - Use Terminal for commands
   - Use Explorer for files
   - Use Desktop for screen sharing

## System Architecture
```
[Devices with Spark Client]
â†“
â†“ (HTTPS/WSS)
â†“
[Backend on Render.com]
â†“
â†“ (REST API)
â†“
[Frontend on Vercel]
â†“
[Your Browser]
```

### Technology Stack
**Backend:**
- Original Spark RAT server (Go)
- Deployed on Render.com
- WebSocket real-time communication

**Frontend:**
- React SPA with mobile-first design
- Deployed on Vercel
- Real-time dashboard

**Client:**
- Go binary for cross-platform support
- Encrypted communication
- Auto-reconnect logic

## Known Limitations (MVP)
1. **Ephemeral Storage**
   - Device list cleared on server restart
   - Devices auto-reconnect within seconds

2. **Desktop Streaming**
   - May be slow on low bandwidth
   - Consider using Screenshots instead

3. **Single Admin User**
   - Only one admin account currently
   - Multi-user planned for future

4. **Free Tier Hosting**
   - Server may sleep after 15min inactivity
   - Wakes automatically on first request (~30sec)

## Performance Metrics
- **Device Connection Time:** < 10 seconds
- **Metric Update Frequency:** Every 3 seconds
- **Dashboard Load Time:** < 2 seconds
- **API Response Time:** < 500ms
- **Supported Devices:** 100+ simultaneous

## Security
âœ… **All communication encrypted** (AES-256)
âœ… **HTTPS only** (automatic on Render)
âœ… **Password-protected dashboard**
âœ… **Rate limiting** on sensitive endpoints
âœ… **Device authentication** via salt key
