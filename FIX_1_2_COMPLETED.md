# FIX 1.2: Clone Original Spark Repository - COMPLETED

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Done:
- Successfully cloned https://github.com/XZB-1248/Spark.git to /tmp/spark-original
- Verified critical files exist:
  - ✅ server/main.go (server software)
  - ✅ client/ (client software)
  - ✅ modules/ (shared modules)
  - ✅ utils/ (utility functions)
  - ✅ go.mod, go.sum (Go dependencies)

## Repository Structure:
```

├── client/          # Client software
├── server/          # Server software
├── modules/         # Shared modules
├── utils/           # Utility functions
