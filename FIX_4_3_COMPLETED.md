3. **Deployment validation**: Both services tested and accessible

## Verification Results:
- Backend health check: ✅ Responding
- Frontend accessibility: ✅ Responding
- SSL certificates: ✅ Valid
- Environment variables: ✅ Configured
- Security headers: ✅ Implemented
- Monitoring: ✅ Configured

## Production Readiness Checklist:
- ✅ Backend deployed and accessible
