- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable alert thresholds

##### Management Functions
- **Whitelist Management**: Add/remove IPs from whitelist
- **Blacklist Management**: Add/remove IPs from blacklist
- **Statistics Reset**: Reset all security statistics
- **Health Checks**: System health monitoring

### ✅ Integration with Main Application:

#### Updated Main Application (main.go)
- **Comprehensive Security Manager**: Integrated new security manager
- **Proper Middleware Order**: Security middleware in correct order
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Automatic configuration selection
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient middleware ordering

#### Middleware Order
1. **Security Headers**: Set security headers first
2. **CORS**: Handle cross-origin requests
3. **DDoS Protection**: Block DDoS attacks early
4. **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting
5. **IP Blocking**: Block malicious IPs
6. **Request Validation**: Validate requests last

### ✅ Security Features Implemented:

#### Rate Limiting Protection
- **Global Rate Limiting**: 500-1000 requests per second globally
- **Per-IP Rate Limiting**: 50-100 requests per second per IP
- **Per-User Rate Limiting**: 25-50 requests per second per user
- **Burst Protection**: 5-10 requests per 10 seconds
- **Whitelist Bypass**: Trusted IPs bypass rate limiting
- **Blacklist Blocking**: Malicious IPs completely blocked

#### DDoS Protection
- **Connection Limiting**: 500-1000 maximum concurrent connections
- **Per-IP Limits**: 5-10 connections per IP
- **Request Rate Analysis**: Per-minute and per-second analysis
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Pattern-based detection
