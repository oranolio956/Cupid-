# FIX 2.1: Replace Custom Client with Original Spark Client - COMPLETED

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Done:
The custom client has already been replaced with the original Spark client with full RAT functionality.

### ✅ Client Features Implemented:
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Server can send commands to client
- **Terminal Sessions**: Execute shell commands remotely
- **File Operations**: Upload/download files, browse directories
- **Desktop Capture**: Stream screen in real-time
- **Process Management**: List/kill/start processes
- **Screenshot**: Capture single screen image
- **System Control**: Lock, restart, shutdown
- **Packet Encryption**: Uses salt from config.json to encrypt all traffic
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatically reconnects if connection drops
- **Service Mode**: Can run as background service

### ✅ Server Configuration:
- **Host**: spark-backend-fixed-v2.onrender.com
- **Port**: 443 (HTTPS)
- **Path**: /api
- **Secure**: true (HTTPS only)
- **Salt**: a2dac101827c8d47f00831f2d6c078b2 (matches server)

### ✅ Cross-Platform Builds:
- **Windows**: spark-client-windows.exe (9.9MB)
- **Linux**: spark-client-linux (9.8MB)
- **Linux ARM**: spark-client-linux-arm (9.3MB)

### ✅ Installation Scripts:
- **Windows**: install-windows.ps1 (PowerShell script)
- **Linux**: install-linux.sh (Bash script)
- **Service Installation**: Automatic service setup for both platforms

### ✅ Client Structure:
- **client.go**: Main entry point
- **core/**: Core functionality (device, handler, core)
- **service/**: Feature services (terminal, desktop, file, screenshot, process)
- **config/**: Configuration management (production.go, config.go)
- **utils/**: Utility functions
- **modules/**: Shared modules

## Verification:
- All feature services present ✅
- Server configuration correct ✅
- Salt matches server ✅
- Cross-platform builds available ✅
- Installation scripts provided ✅
- Service mode supported ✅

## Next Steps:
- FIX 2.2: Configure Client for Your Server (already done)
- FIX 2.3: Build Client for Multiple Platforms (already done)
- FIX 2.4: Create Client Installation Scripts (already done)

## Note:
This fix was already completed in previous work. The client is the full original Spark RAT client with all advanced features, not just basic monitoring.
